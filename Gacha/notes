Things to do:

Code:
- prevent the handle being spammed (ball must be clicked before the handle can be clicked again)
(maybe with a loop?)
- make yellow a rare color (1/50 or 1/100)
- make the machine change every now and then

Graphics and non-code-things:
- make a new machine (kawaii style)
- write cute things
- make cute background
- add some music?
- add sound effects
